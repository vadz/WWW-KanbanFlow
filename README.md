Proof of Concept Module for KanbanFlow API
==========================================

**WARNING**: This is a draft/proof-of-concept only.

This [Raku][] module wraps API for adding tasks to [KanbanFlow][] using its
API. It can be (and was) used to import existing issues from another tracker.

No future development is planned, but what is there does seem to work.
